# nstd
A non-standard C++ library. This project has two aims:
* Provide a convenient location for me to list features that I would like to have in the C++ standard library

* Contain my implementations of these features

I will try to implement these features in such a way that they would fit into the standard library.

To make consuming this library as easy as possible it will be header only.

## Features
### Serialisable Enum
It would be very convenient when writing parsers if strongly-typed enums could be converted directly to their string representations.
Implemented? :heavy_check_mark:
### Parsing
* Provide a nice way to split strings
	* Implemented? :x:

## Contributing
I would be interested in hearing about more functionality that's "missing" from the standard library - feel free to raise an MR to add items to this README. I would also appreciate suggestions to improve existing implementations, or even completely new implementations to evaluate.
